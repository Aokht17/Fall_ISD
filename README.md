# Immunosuppressive domains in human genome  
Immunosuppressive domains (ISD) are usually short (about 20-40 amino acids) peptide sequences that have retroviral (and some other viruses’) origin or are similar to viral envelope glycoproteins and are able to interact with immune cells’ receptors leading to an inhibition of the response and immunosuppression.  
## Aims of the project
The aim of the project was to find tissue-specific immunosuppressive domains in human genome using predicted artificial peptides from patent as a query template.
